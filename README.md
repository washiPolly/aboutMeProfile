Redesigning my About Me page with Bootstrap

Directions
First, you will use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to recreate your portfolio. How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:


Create the following pages: index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.


Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:


A navbar


A responsive layout


Responsive images




The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.



Hints


Use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).


On an xs screen, content should take up the entire screen. On sm and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.



Minimum Requirements


Functional, deployed application


GitHub repository with README describing the project



Bonus

Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (Hint: Check out the Bootstrap documentation).
